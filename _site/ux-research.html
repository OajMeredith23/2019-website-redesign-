                    With a clear target market, with clear problems to be addressed and a problem statement created I began sketch noting. This process was used to rapidly get ideas down onto paper, most of which it would be immediately apparent were pretty terrible, but some would hold water. Separating between the two was done by create a decision matrix, this involved stating a concise description of the idea, and ranking the value of that idea against various considerations. Out of this process it becomes clear that combining two ideas would the best option - ‘Conneting NEETs with professionals’ and ‘Gamified career advisor’.
